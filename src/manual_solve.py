#Function 1: Solve 08ed6ac7.json

#Description: 
#This transformation returns the colours of the columns in order from highest to lowest
#Blue is mapped to the largest column, Red to the second largest, Green to the third Largest,
#and Yellow is mapped to the smallest column. 

#Statement: 
#All training/test grids are returned correctly.

#Function 2: Solve 4258a5f9.json

#Description:
#This transformation will take in an array and determine what values of the array are equal to 5(Grey Squares)
#These grey squares will then be surrounded by a full outer ring of blue squares. 
#This essentially blocks any grey squares with an full outer blue square.

#Statement:
#All training/test grids are returned correctly.

#Above function, creates empty lists to be used to determine what columns and rows are required within the transformation. 
#the function checks, in order of columns, then rows for any single values that equal to 2. It appends the col to the empty list,
#and then performs a transformation on the column and updates the whole column to 2.
#The function then checks the rows for any single values that equal 3 or 1, it then converts all the rows present in the list to match the value found within the bluerow / greenrow lists. 
#Completing it in this order will overwrite any of the rows that have been transformed correctly over the columns.
